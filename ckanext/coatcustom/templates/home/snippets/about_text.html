<p>COAT (Climate-ecological  Observatory  for  Arctic  Tundra, www.coat.no) is an adaptive,
    ecosystem based, observation system for Arctic tundra in Norway. </p><br>

    <p>The COAT Data Portal hosts ecological and climatic primary monitoring
    data from COATs monitoring sites in high-arctic (Svalbard) and low-arctic
    (Varanger) tundra, as well as certain prioritized data from outside these regions.
    In addition, the COAT Data Portal contains a number of secondary (derived) data sets,
    termed COAT state variables, which are calculated from primary data originating
    either from within COAT  or  requested  from  other  data  repositories.
    The  state  variables  are  the  primary  input  to  the quantitative analysis
    and predictive modelling performed in COAT. </p><br>

    <p>In COAT we aim to publish all research data unless limited by either
    privacy or license restrictions. This means that the majority of
    COAT data are distributed under the Creative Commons Public License
    (CC BY 4.0). Our commitment to data access includes the provision of metadata
    to enable data users to assess the content and significance of the data they
    download, as well as codes necessary to produce the summary analyses,
    tables and plots that in time will be provided on the COAT web site. </p><br>
